Rune Manager for Summoners War


To start with the instructions, we will assume you can upload your data to Swarfarm already. And if you are not there yet, check the Discord server on the sidebar, someone will help you there.

1- Download your Swarfarm data file. If you are already logged into your Swarfarm account, you can click [HERE](https://swarfarm.com/profile/Maarnak/export/swop_optimizer/) to download it automatically. If you want to download it manually, make sure you use the SWOP Optimizer compatible download. The file will be named YourName_swarfarm_win10_optimizer_export.json, and it will be on your default download folder.

2- Upload your json file from **Step 1** into SWOP, through the **IMPORT VIA JSON FILE** option, choose the file, and after a few seconds it will load. Click Import, and wait until it is ready. You will see an aqua message on the top right corner of your screen, telling you that the upload has been completed.

3- Still on SWOP, click the Export Data button, that will get you a file named swop-data.json. 

4- Go to the [Parsing website](http://convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm). I know it doesn't look user friendly, but just follow the steps, we will be done in no time.

5- Under Select your input, click on **Choose File**, that will display a new tab. Go to the button that says **Choose file**(Right under the first Choose File we clicked on this step). Choose your swop-data.json from **Step 3**

6- Click the button JSON to Excel, and give it a little time to upload your file and convert it to what we need. As soon as it is done, it will automatically download as **convertcsv.xlsx**. If it doesn't, after the page is available, click download result.

7- Open your **convertcsv.xlsx** and **Rune Manager Final.xlsx**, copy all the information on Sheet1 from convertcsv to the Rune Manager, paste the entire thing on the Paste Here sign.

8- Go to the second tab, edit your required substats at speed, +6, +9 and +12 and it will tell you which runes to sell, which to upgrade for a better calculation and even let you filter them and play around with them.

Special thanks to, u/Porksmash, u/Xzandro and whoever made that conversion tool, please don't sue my ass.
